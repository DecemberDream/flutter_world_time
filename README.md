# World Time

This is a simple Flutter project which makes use of the [WorldTimeAPI](https://worldtimeapi.org/) to fetch the times of many cities world wide.

## The App

Essentially, the app has 2 screens, including a loading screen. The home screen looks as follows (note: the dark background is chosen if the time is between 6am - 8pm).
